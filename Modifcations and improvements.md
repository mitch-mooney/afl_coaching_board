# Modifcations and improvements

* When animating allow for animation to occur in small phases e.g. phase one: ball goes fom starting point which initiates player movement then phase 2: ball intercepted and changes direction which make players change paths. This way you can chunk animations into smaller smoother segements allowing for pausing and coaching.
