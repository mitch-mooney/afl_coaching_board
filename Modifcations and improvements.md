# Modifcations and improvements

* Allow an easier ability to handle player roster. Issue is "I can have a list of players like this:
https://www.playhq.com/afl/org/afl-canberra/afl-canberra-2025/afl-canberra-2025-first-grade-men/game-centre/d19ffaa7

But each player is ordered by number not position, If there can be the ability to import baulk names then ask if you'd like to assign position or if they are already in position starting.

* The starting positions when logging in should be a center bounce the wing positions need to be outside of the center square, the full forward and their oppositing full back should start in the goal square and all of the other forwards e.g. FP, HFF CHF and their corresponding defenders e.g. FB, HBF, CHB are required to be inside their appropriate 50m arcs.

* A more engaging background would be great something that resembles sky or a crowd something ask the frontend-design plugin

* Have a show position as well as show names.

* When animating allow for animation to occur in small phases e.g. phase one: ball goes fom starting point which initiates player movement then phase 2: ball intercepted and changes direction which make players change paths. This way you can chunk animations into smaller smoother segements allowing for pausing and coaching.

* please ensure that the data to be stored in the supabase database is actually getting there at the moment playbooks are being stored locally cache and not being submitted to the database.

* Check sharing capabilities the links provided don't load into field they just have the player names in a list.
